# ML Performance Models Survey

## Goal

Write a paper for **MICRO 2026** that provides a systematic review of high-level ML performance models and simulators.

## Scope

- Survey existing ML performance modeling approaches
- Review simulation tools for ML workloads
- Compare analytical models vs. simulation-based methods
- Identify gaps and future research directions

## Milestones

- [ ] **M1: Literature Collection** — Gather relevant papers and tools
- [ ] **M2: Taxonomy** — Develop classification framework
- [ ] **M3: Analysis** — Deep dive into key approaches
- [ ] **M4: Writing** — Draft paper sections
- [ ] **M5: Submission** — Polish and submit to MICRO 2026

## Output

- LaTeX paper in `paper/` directory
- Reference collection in `references/`
- Analysis notes in `docs/`
