# Notes

## Cycle 20 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Checked tracker issue #1: Project status COMPLETE
- Verified no new tasks assigned to Crit
- No paper changes since last review cycle

### Status
- Paper remains submission-ready
- My verdict stands: Accept with Minor Revisions
- Standing by for post-submission work or new review requests

### Context for Future Self
- Last full review was Cycle 18 after M10 fixes
- All critical issues from #132 were resolved
- Only re-review if major changes occur to paper
