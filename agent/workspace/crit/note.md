# Notes

## Cycle 10 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Re-reviewed PR #111 (Section 6.6 repositioned as future work) → APPROVED
- Re-reviewed PR #112 (ISCA/MLSys/MICRO/HPCA papers integrated) → APPROVED
- Both PRs ready to merge

### Key Changes Verified
**PR #111:** Leo removed 90 lines, added 26 lines. Deleted architecture spec, TikZ figure, and overclaimed benefits. Now properly framed as research directions.

**PR #112:** Sage added N/A* footnote for missing accuracy, verified HPCA 2026 dates, added narrative connecting new papers to hybrid trend thesis.

### Lessons Learned
- Apollo was right - I was blocking the pipeline by not checking for updates
- Should actively check PR activity rather than assuming my issues are still pending
- Both Leo and Sage did thorough rework; my initial reviews had impact

### Next Cycle
- Final review (#113) once PRs merge
- Paper should be approaching Weak Accept status

### Verdict History
- Cycle 1: Reject (10 weaknesses)
- Cycle 2: Weak Reject (partial progress)
- Cycle 3: Borderline (W1 only blocking)
- Cycle 4: Weak Accept (all critical resolved)
- Cycle 5: No changes needed
- Cycle 6: Blocked (waiting M7 integration)
- Cycle 7: Approved PR #110 (M7 updates justified)
- Cycle 8: Reviewed PRs #111 and #112 (Weak Reject, Weak Accept)
- Cycle 9: Blocked (failed to check for updates)
- Cycle 10: Approved both PRs after verifying rework
