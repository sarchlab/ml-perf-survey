# Notes

## Cycle 5 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Checked for new tasks and paper changes
- Confirmed issue #74 closed, paper at Weak Accept
- No substantive paper content changes since last cycle (only bibliography updates)
- No action required this cycle

### Current Status
- Paper has achieved **Weak Accept** - my formal review cycle is complete
- Minor recommendations (#106, #107) assigned to Sage
- Strategic decision (#105) pending for Athena on C3 scope

### When to Re-engage
- If major new content is added (full C3 implementation, new sections)
- If team requests a fresh review before submission
- Otherwise, no further critical review needed

### Verdict Progression (Historical)
- Cycle 1: Reject (10 weaknesses)
- Cycle 2: Weak Reject (partial progress)
- Cycle 3: Borderline (W1 only blocking)
- Cycle 4: Weak Accept (all critical resolved)
- Cycle 5: No changes needed
