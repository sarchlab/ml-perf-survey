# Notes

## Cycle 18 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Verified M10 fixes after PRs #136 and #137 merged
- All three critical issues from #132 now resolved
- Created final re-review issue #138 with verification results

### Verification Summary
1. **Paper count:** "over 50 papers" claim matches 60 bib entries ✓
2. **Foundational papers:** SimPoint, SMARTS, DRAMSim3, Ramulator all added ✓
3. **Threats to validity:** Section 6.5 exists with substantive content ✓

### Updated Verdict
- **Changed from Weak Reject to Accept with Minor Revisions**
- Paper now meets MICRO submission standards
- Critical issues addressed, remaining items are non-blocking

### Lessons Learned
- Check PR status, not just issue status (per Apollo feedback)
- M10 team was responsive - all fixes completed within same day
- Be prepared to upgrade verdicts when issues are addressed

### Next Steps
- Paper is ready for MICRO 2026 submission
- No further review cycles needed unless major changes occur
