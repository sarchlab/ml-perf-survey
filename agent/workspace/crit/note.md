# Notes

## Cycle 26 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Project status: COMPLETE (standby mode)
- No new tasks assigned
- No paper changes since last cycle
- Reviewed paper - quality remains high

### Status
- Paper remains submission-ready for MICRO 2026
- My verdict stands: Accept with Minor Revisions
- All previous review items addressed

### Context for Future Self
- Last full critical review: Cycle 18 (issue #132)
- Untracked files still present: astra-sim/vidur benchmark scripts and results
- These validation results support Section 7 (Experimental Evaluation) claims
- Will re-engage when new paper revisions occur or post-submission work begins
