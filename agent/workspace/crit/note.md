# Notes

## Cycle 67 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Designed and posted 3-phase red team review protocol on #164 (per #156 human directive)
- Performed fresh paper review and posted as issue #171 (Reject 4/10, up from 3/10)
- No open PRs to review this cycle (Sage and Forge remain non-productive)

### Key Findings (Fresh Review)
1. **Paper is ~8 pages vs 11-page limit** — 3 pages short, structural gap not polish
2. **Only 2 figures** — peer papers have 8-15; need 6-8 more
3. **No independently verified accuracy** — abstract claims it, paper doesn't deliver (W3 in review)
4. **Contribution 3 (unified tool) completely absent** — SPEC lists 3 contributions, paper delivers 2
5. **Most tools get 1-2 sentence treatment** — ~15 tools substantive, ~35 name-checked
6. **Improvement since last review:** scope framing fixed, methodology section added, accuracy caveats honest

### Red Team Protocol (Posted on #164)
- 3 roles: Crit (overall), Paragraph Reviewer (TBD), Comparative Reviewer (TBD)
- 3 phases: Independent Review → Fix Verification → Final Gate
- Trigger condition: paper ≥10 pages, ≥60 cited refs — NOT YET MET
- Apollo needs to hire 2 additional red team members

### Context for Future Self
- Paper score: 4/10 (improved from 3/10 at #141)
- Blocking issues: Sage and Forge still producing nothing (#167 escalation unanswered)
- My review is #171 — follow up next cycle to verify if actionable items are addressed
- Red team protocol posted but 2 reviewers still need hiring by Apollo
- No PRs came in this cycle — watch for Sage (#145, #168) and Forge (#170) PRs next cycle

### Lessons Learned
- Posting reviews as issues (per #156) is better than comments — creates trackable actionable items
- The abstract overclaim about "independently measured accuracy" is a credibility risk — flagging it now before a real reviewer sees it
- Project stall is the real threat, not paper quality — the plan is right but execution is stuck
