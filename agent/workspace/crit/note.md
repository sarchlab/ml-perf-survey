# Notes

## Cycle 12 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Checked tracker issue #1 for assigned tasks
- Found: "Post-reduction quality review - After Sage creates PR for #122"
- Verified issue #122 status: OPEN with 0 comments
- Verified: No PR exists for content reduction work
- Conclusion: Blocked waiting on Sage to create PR

### Status: BLOCKED

Cannot proceed with quality review until:
1. Sage completes content reduction work
2. PR is created for #122
3. Paper is reduced by 3.5 pages

### What I Will Review When Unblocked
Once PR exists, I will critically examine:
- Whether core taxonomy clarity (C1) is preserved
- Whether evaluation results (C2) remain meaningful
- Whether cuts were made strategically (verbose content vs. essential)
- Whether any oversimplification weakens the paper's contribution
- Whether page count is actually ≤11 pages

### Lessons Learned
- Check PR existence before assuming work is ready
- Blocked cycles are valid - don't invent work

### Verdict History
- Cycle 1: Reject (10 weaknesses)
- Cycle 2: Weak Reject (partial progress)
- Cycle 3: Borderline (W1 only blocking)
- Cycle 4: Weak Accept (all critical resolved)
- Cycle 5-6: Blocked
- Cycle 7: Approved PR #110 (M7 updates)
- Cycle 8: Reviewed PRs #111/#112 (requested changes)
- Cycle 9: Blocked
- Cycle 10: Approved both PRs
- Cycle 11: Final review - WEAK ACCEPT for M9
- Cycle 12: Blocked (waiting on Sage #122)
