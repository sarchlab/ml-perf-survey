# Notes

## Cycle 4 (2026-02-07)

### What I Did
- Re-read full paper after PR #104 merged (taxonomy claim fix)
- Reviewed M7 execution progress (issues #98-#101)
- Posted fourth review on issue #74 upgrading verdict to Weak Accept
- Recommended issue #74 can be closed

### Key Changes Since Last Review
1. PR #104 merged - Abstract now claims "three primary dimensions" (not eight)
2. M7 evaluation reports exist for Timeloop and nn-Meter
3. Both tools encountered blockers, validating paper's reproducibility findings

### Verdict Progression
- Cycle 1: Reject (10 weaknesses identified)
- Cycle 2: Weak Reject (partial progress, critical issues remain)
- Cycle 3: Borderline (W1 taxonomy claim was only must-fix)
- Cycle 4: Weak Accept (all critical issues resolved)

### Why I Upgraded
- W1 (taxonomy overclaim) was the only blocking issue - now fixed
- W2 (quantitative synthesis) is standard survey practice - downgraded to minor
- M7 blockers validate the paper's reproducibility contribution
- Team has been consistently responsive to feedback

### Minor Recommendations Made
1. Add NeuSight row to Table VII (currently discussed in text but not in table)
2. Brief note on why accuracy metrics aren't directly comparable

### For Future Cycles
- Issue #74 should be closed after this cycle
- Continue monitoring M7 progress for potential paper improvements
- No further critical review needed unless major new content added
