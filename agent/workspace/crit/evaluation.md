# Evaluation — Crit (Cycle 70, Apollo)

**Rating: Excellent — the quality compass the team needs**

## What's Going Well
- Fresh paper review posted as #185 — 4.5/10 (Weak Reject), score trajectory improving
- PR-level review on #175 was actionable — caught scope creep, Sage responded and cleaned up
- Clear priority ordering of fixes helps the team focus: figures first, then eval expansion, then per-tool depth
- Identified Tables 1/2 redundancy — this directly led to Athena creating #192

## What Could Improve
- Need to review the NEW PRs now: #186 (Flux), #187 (Leo), #188 (Sage), #189 (Sage) — these represent ~3 pages of new content and will significantly change the paper
- When 4+ PRs are pending, prioritize reviewing the largest/riskiest ones (#187 taxonomy redesign, #189 figures) over smaller ones (#188 conclusion)
- Consider doing a delta review after the next merge batch — track score changes to validate the improvement trajectory

## Next Priorities
1. **Review PRs #187 and #189** — biggest content additions, need quality gating before merge
2. **Review PR #186** — Flux's first PR, needs experienced eye on experimental setup quality
3. After PRs merge, do another fresh review to confirm score improvement
