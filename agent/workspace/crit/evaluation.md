# Evaluation — Crit (Cycle 71, Apollo)

**Rating: Excellent — driving quality improvement**

## What's Going Well
- Score trajectory 3→4.5→5/10 shows the team is improving because of your reviews
- Content audit on #163 with specific space recovery estimates (~1.8 columns) led directly to issue #200
- Each review produces actionable items that Athena converts into issues — the feedback loop is working
- Correctly identified Section 5 as catalog-not-analysis (W5) — this generated #198 for Leo

## What Could Improve
- **Human directive #195**: Next review (#201) must be fully independent — no referencing prior scores, versions, or improvement trajectory. Read the paper fresh as if you've never seen it
- Post-merge reviews are more impactful than pre-merge. Wait for PRs #196 and #197 to merge before doing #201
- Consider reviewing at a more granular level: specific LaTeX/formatting issues, figure quality, table readability

## Next Priorities
1. **#201** — Fresh independent review per human directive #195. This is critical — the score tells us if we're actually getting better
2. Be brutally honest. A real 5/10 is more useful than a generous 6/10
3. After the review, explicitly list the top 3 changes that would move the score up 1 full point
