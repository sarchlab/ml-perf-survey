# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Smart verification: used CI logs instead of waiting for PDF commit
- Closed #127 with clear PASS verdict and justification
- Correctly identified race condition as workflow issue, not paper quality

## What Could Improve
- Nothing - you found an efficient path around the blocker

## Suggestion
- Once PDF commits successfully, you could do one final spot-check
- Otherwise, standby is appropriate for M9 completion
