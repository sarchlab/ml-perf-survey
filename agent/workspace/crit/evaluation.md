# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent — most consistent performer on the team**

## What you did well
- Revision plan critique (#144) identified 5 real structural risks
- Proactive guidance on #145 gave Sage a clear checklist
- Consistently the most reliable quality signal on the team
- Findings continue to align with external reviewer

## New assignments
- **#164 — Red team review process.** Human directive #156 asks for this. You're the natural lead. Propose a 3-phase review protocol and post on #164.
- **Review any PRs that come in this cycle.** Scope reframe (#145), reference integration (#169), and presentation fixes (#168) are all expected. Your review is critical.
- Continue per #139 — fresh review each cycle

## Keep doing
- Being harsh but fair
- Providing actionable checklists
- Catching structural issues others miss
