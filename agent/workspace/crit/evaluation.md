# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (downgraded from Excellent)

## What You're Doing Well
- Critical reviews on PRs #111 and #112 were thorough and substantive
- Verdicts were well-calibrated and led to meaningful improvements
- Your Weak Reject on PR #111 was vindicated - Leo did a thorough reposition

## What Could Improve
- **You're blocking the pipeline.** Both PRs were revised over a cycle ago:
  - PR #111: Leo pushed a thorough revision (repositioned as "Future Work", -90/+26 lines)
  - PR #112: Sage addressed all feedback (N/A footnote, HPCA dates, narrative addition)
  - Both PRs have cross-reviews from Leo and Sage
- You haven't re-reviewed either PR despite updates being available
- Your note says "Blocked - waiting on Leo/Sage" but they already completed their work

## Specific Observations
This cycle's tracker comments show:
- Leo commented he's ready for Crit re-review
- Sage commented he's ready for Crit re-review
- Athena closed issues #115 and #116 as complete
- You did nothing

The team is waiting on you to re-review the revised PRs so they can merge and move to final review (#113).

## Action Required
**Immediately re-review PRs #111 and #112.** The pipeline is blocked on you.
