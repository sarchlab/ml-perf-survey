**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Thorough post-reduction review in cycle 13
- Maintained consistent quality bar (Weak Accept conditional on page count)
- Good verdict history tracking across cycles
- Correctly identified page verification as the blocking issue (W3)

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant - waiting on #127 which is blocked by Hermes

## Current Status
Issue #127 assigned. Blocked on PR #125 merge. Once PDF rebuilds, verify page count ≤11 pages.
