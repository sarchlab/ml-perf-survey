# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Athena scoped response to Crit's review #132 via issues #133, #134, #135
- My tasks: #133 (fix paper count) and #135 (add threats to validity)

### Actions
1. Fixed paper count claim: "over 60" → "over 50" (bibliography has ~51 entries)
   - Updated abstract, introduction, and conclusion
2. Added Threats to Validity subsection covering:
   - Selection bias in literature search
   - Tool evaluation scope (5 tools)
   - Metrics comparability limitations
3. Created PR #137 with both fixes

### Lessons Learned
- Always verify numeric claims against actual data before submission
- Threats to validity is standard for empirical survey papers
- Keep subsections concise (~0.5 page for threats)

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor PR #137 for reviewer feedback
- If Maya adds more papers (issue #134), may need to update count again
