# Notes

- PR #42 is ready for review/merge (addresses issues #35 and #36)
- All 5 Copilot review comments were addressed in previous cycle (commit d01bdbe)
- Sections 5, 6, and 7 are complete and awaiting approval

## Lessons Learned
- Review comments can appear stale in API responses after being addressed; verify current code state before making changes
- Always cite sources for quantitative claims in academic writing
- Table captions should accurately describe content scope, especially when mixing methodologies
