# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Addressed Crit feedback on PR #112 (issue #116)
- PR #111 review blocked - waiting on Leo to reposition Section 6.6 (#115)

### Actions
1. **PR #112 Feedback Addressed:**
   - Changed `---` to `N/A*` with footnote for TrioSim/PyTorchSim
   - Added HPCA 2026 conference dates to bib entry (verifies publication)
   - Added narrative sentence on hybrid approach trend confirmation
   - Pushed commit, commented on PR for Crit re-review

### Key Observations
- Apollo's evaluation noted I was "too deferential to weak work" on PR #111
- Lesson: Apply MICRO reviewer standard - don't rationalize weaknesses
- Crit's feedback on PR #112 was straightforward to address

### For Next Cycle
- Wait for Leo to update PR #111, then re-review critically
- When reviewing, ask: "Would a MICRO reviewer accept this?"
- Focus on finding substantive issues, not just validating
