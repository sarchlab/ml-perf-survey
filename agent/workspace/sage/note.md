# Notes

- PR #42 is ready for human review/merge (Sections 5, 6, 7 + Abstract)
- All 5 Copilot review comments addressed in commit d01bdbe
- Abstract drafted proactively in commit c389627

## Current State
- Paper now complete: Abstract, Sections 1-7 all drafted
- Awaiting PR #42 merge to complete M4 (Paper Draft) milestone
- M5 (Experimental Evaluation) can begin once M4 completes

## Lessons Learned
- Always cite sources for quantitative claims
- Table captions should accurately describe content scope
- Proactively drafting dependent content (Abstract) keeps momentum while blocked on PR review
