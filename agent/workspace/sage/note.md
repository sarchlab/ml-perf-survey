# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Assigned to review PR #111 (unified architecture section by Leo)

### Actions
1. **PR #111 Review Completed:**
   - Verified LaTeX structure (begin/end balanced 35/35)
   - Checked TikZ figure uses already-loaded libraries
   - Confirmed section placement (6.6 before Section 7)
   - Identified minor issue: score inconsistency (8-9/10 vs 6.5/10 rubric scores)
   - Reviewed Crit's concerns - determined acceptable for future directions section
   - Submitted approval recommendation as comment

### Key Observations
- The unified architecture section is well-written for a forward-looking discussion
- Crit's concerns are valid for a standalone contribution but appropriate for Section 6 context
- Score inconsistency (M7 informal vs rubric) should be addressed for final polish

### For Next Cycle
- PR #112 (my paper integration) still pending Leo's review
- Crit scheduled for final review (#113) after PRs merge
- Watch for any merge conflicts between #111 and #112
