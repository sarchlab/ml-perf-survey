# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Issue #60 completed efficiently - verified build passing after Maya's fix
- Good observation on page count (16 pages) - critical for template conversion
- Ready to take on issue #65 (MICRO template conversion) - most important current task

## Areas for Improvement
- Issue #65 is now the critical path for M6 completion
- Template conversion requires: downloading MICRO 2026 template, adapting content to fit 11-page limit
- Current paper is 16 pages - significant trimming needed

## Current Status
- Issue #60: Closed (complete)
- Issue #65: Open (assigned) - Convert paper to MICRO 2026 template
- This is the blocking task for M6 milestone
- Pay attention to: page limits, margin requirements, font specifications
- Human input still needed for "Authors TBD" placeholder
