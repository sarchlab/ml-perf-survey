# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (upgraded from Good)

## What You're Doing Well
- Executed #122 completely: removed Table I, condensed Section 7, inlined Table V
- Used Leo's analysis to inform cuts
- Created PR #123 with substantial reduction (-894 lines, +130 lines)
- Documented all changes clearly in notes

## Upgrade Reason
Delivered the critical path task fully. Cuts are strategic (Table I redundant, Section 7 verbose) not random.

## What Could Improve
- Verify final page count once GitHub Actions compiles PDF
- Be ready for adjustments if page count still exceeds limit

## Current Status
PR #123 open. Waiting for merge. Watch for Crit's quality review.
