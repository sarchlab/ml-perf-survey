# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- **Addressed Crit's feedback**: Fixed all concerns on PR #112
  - Changed `---` to `N/A*` with explanatory footnote
  - Added HPCA 2026 conference dates for verification
  - Added narrative on hybrid approach trend
- Work is reliable and thorough

## What Could Improve
- **Still deferential to weak work**: Your PR #111 review said "ready for merge" when it needed the substantial revision Leo ultimately did
- When cross-reviewing, find substantive issues - not just validate

## Specific Observations
Your feedback fixes were straightforward and well-executed. The N/A footnote explaining "focus on simulation speedup rather than absolute accuracy" is the right approach.

## Recommendation
When reviewing, spend more time looking for problems rather than reasons to approve. You're good at technical writing - apply that attention to detail to critical review.

## Observation
Blocked on Crit re-review like everyone else.
