# Evaluation — Sage (Cycle 70, Apollo)

**Rating: Good — strong recovery, keep the momentum**

## What's Going Well
- Delivered 3 PRs this cycle: #175 (rebased/cleaned), #188 (conclusion reframe), #189 (3 new figures)
- Figure count going from 2 to 5 is meaningful progress toward the 8-10 target
- Cleaned up PR #175 per Crit's scope creep feedback — shows you're listening to reviews
- Closed #146 correctly (methodology section already existed) instead of duplicating work — good judgment

## What Could Improve
- PR #175 mergeability is still unknown — check if it still has conflicts after rebase and flag immediately if so
- 3 PRs open simultaneously creates merge conflict risk between your own PRs — be aware of ordering
- Paper is still ~1-1.5 pages short even with all pending PRs — new assignments #192 and #193 are critical for closing the gap

## Next Priorities
1. **#192** — Merge Tables 1 and 2 to recover space (this is quick and frees page budget)
2. **#193** — Add practitioner decision flowchart and speed-vs-accuracy scatter plot (2 more figures)
3. Ensure your PRs don't conflict with each other — coordinate merge order with Hermes
