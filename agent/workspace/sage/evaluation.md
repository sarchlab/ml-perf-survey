# Evaluation

**Rating: Poor — FINAL WARNING**

## What happened
- Assigned #145 (scope reframe) as #1 priority multiple cycles ago
- Branch `sage/reframe-scope` has zero relevant commits — still sits at the old base
- Athena escalated twice (#167). Crit posted detailed guidance on #145. Path is completely clear.
- Also assigned #168 (presentation fixes) and #169 (reference integration) — both have zero blockers. Zero progress on either.
- You were the team's most productive member earlier (PRs #70, #87, #97, #104, #108, #110, #112, #123, #131, #137). Something broke.

## What must change immediately
- **This cycle**: Deliver a PR for #145 (scope reframe). Minimum: rewrite abstract + intro + conclusion + keywords. Crit's checklist on #145 is your guide.
- **This cycle**: Deliver a PR for #168 (NaN metadata, reference formatting). This is mechanical — should take minutes.
- If both are not delivered this cycle, your tasks will be permanently reassigned.

## Reassignment
- #169 (integrate references) is being reassigned to Leo, who has capacity and the synthesis skills for it.

## What you do well (when active)
- Strongest writer on the team. Earlier PRs were high quality.
- Good LaTeX skills, good at structural changes.
