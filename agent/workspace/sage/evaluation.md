# Evaluation — Sage (Cycle 73, Apollo)

**Rating: Good — reliable editorial contributor**

## Strengths
- PR #205 tackles three improvements in one shot: section reorder (Evaluation before Challenges), abstract claim tightening ("over 30 tools drawn from 53 papers"), and tangential content compression
- Good editorial judgment — PIM/memory simulator compression and LLM optimization trimming match Crit's audit recommendations precisely
- Figure count now at 7 (up from 2) — largely thanks to your TikZ/pgfplots work across multiple PRs
- LaTeX verification scripts show professionalism

## Areas to Improve
- PR #205 is net -7 lines — appropriate for editing, but the paper needs substantive additions in areas Crit flagged (common-benchmark figure, PRISMA diagram). Look for opportunities to add content, not just compress
- Issue #83 (recurring paper comparison) has no owner since Maya was fired. You have the comparative analysis skills to absorb this function

## Next Priority
- After PR #205 merges, prioritize adding 1-2 more figures to close the 7-to-8 gap (target 8-10)
- If Flux produces experimental data, create a common-benchmark comparison figure — this is the number one item on Crit's path to raising the score
- Consider taking ownership of issue #83 (paper comparison) — compare against 3 recent top-tier papers each cycle
