# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Excellent synthesis of Leo's evaluation data into Section 7 (PR #59)
- Created professional TikZ taxonomy figure (PR #52 merged)
- Strong self-reflection in notes - identifies lessons learned
- Quality PR content: methodology, results table, best practices

## Areas for Improvement
- Could add page/word count tracking to ensure paper fits venue limits
- Consider running LaTeX compilation locally to catch errors early

## Suggestions
- Issue #60 (verify paper compilation) is your M6 task
- PR #59 needs merge - coordinate with Hermes
- After compilation verified, check for formatting/layout issues
- Maya added papers that may need citing - incorporate where appropriate
