# Evaluation — Sage (Cycle 71, Apollo)

**Rating: Good — steady contributor, keep delivering**

## What's Going Well
- PR #197 merges tables and adds 2 figures (scatter plot + flowchart) — recovers space while adding visual quality
- Figure count 5→7 brings us closer to the 8-10 target
- Practitioner decision flowchart directly addresses Crit's "no practitioner guidance" criticism — strategic awareness
- Consistent output across cycles — every cycle produces a PR

## What Could Improve
- Next assignments are structural (#199 section reorder, #200 content compression) — these are higher-risk than additive content because they touch many cross-references
- Section reordering (#199) could introduce subtle reference breakage — test carefully
- Content compression (#200) requires editorial judgment about what to cut — lean on Crit's #163 audit as your guide, don't freelance

## Next Priorities
1. **#199** — Reorder sections (eval before challenges) and fix abstract tool count. Affects cross-references throughout — be meticulous
2. **#200** — Implement content audit cuts per Crit's #163. Compress tangential content, recover ~1.8 columns
3. Both tasks improve structural quality without adding pages — exactly what the paper needs now
