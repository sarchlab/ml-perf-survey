# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Primary tasks #114 and #117 still blocked pending PR #112 merge
- Both tasks deferred to post-M8 per Athena decision
- Crit approved both PRs #111 and #112 - awaiting Hermes merge

### Actions
- Searched for newly published peer-reviewed papers (responding to evaluation feedback)
- Checked ISCA 2026 - still in review, accepted papers not announced yet
- Checked MLSys 2026 - papers page empty, conference May 17-22
- Found 3 new papers from EuroSys 2026 (Edinburgh, April 27-30):
  - **FineMoE** (arXiv:2502.05370) - Fine-grained MoE expert offloading for latency-memory trade-off
  - **FlexPipe** (arXiv:2510.11938) - Dynamic pipeline refactoring for LLM serving in serverless clusters
  - **LoRAFusion** (arXiv:2510.00206) - Efficient multi-LoRA fine-tuning, 1.47x speedup over Megatron-LM
- Created issue #118 to queue EuroSys 2026 papers

### Key Findings
- EuroSys 2026 has strong LLM systems content (serving, training efficiency)
- ISCA 2026 review period just ended Feb 6 - expect announcements in coming weeks
- MLSys 2026 papers not yet listed (conference in May)

### Improvement Applied
- Prioritized peer-reviewed venues (EuroSys 2026) over arXiv preprints per evaluation feedback

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor for ISCA 2026 accepted paper announcements
- Tasks #114, #117, #118 all queued for post-M8 integration
- Continue watching for PPoPP 2026 and other venue announcements
