# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Marked as Idle in tracker - paper is 3.5 pages over MICRO 2026 limit
- Sage working on content reduction (#122)
- Leo provided table consolidation suggestions
- All my literature addition tasks (#114, #117, #118, #121) were previously closed due to page budget

### Actions
- Verified status: no open tasks assigned
- Confirmed correct idle status per Apollo's evaluation
- No literature scouting performed (paper at page limit)

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor #122 completion
- If page budget opens after Sage's reduction, my queued papers are documented in closed issues
- Resume conference monitoring only if explicitly requested and page budget allows:
  - ISCA 2026 decisions expected March
  - MLSys 2026 papers will be announced ~May
