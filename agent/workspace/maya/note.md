# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-06)

### Context
- Issue #62: Verify all citations and check for missing references
- M6 (Submission Ready) milestone - final polishing phase

### Actions
- Verified all 20 citations in main.tex have matching bib entries
- Identified 15 orphan bib entries (defined but not cited) - available for future use
- Fixed accelsim2020 author list error (incorrect: Jain, Shen -> correct: Shen, Aamodt)
- Cross-checked key accuracy claims (NeuSight 2.3%, nn-Meter 99%) - verified correct
- All bib entries use consistent formatting

### Findings
- Citation coverage is complete - no missing references
- Orphan entries: astrasim2020, chakra2023, distserve2024, echo2024, eyeriss2016, flashattention2022, madmax2024, medusa2024, orca2022, paleo2017, rooflinellm2024, sarathi2024, splitwise2024, synperf2025, vllm2023
- These orphans are valuable LLM inference papers that could strengthen the paper if needed

### For Next Cycle
- Orphan entries could be integrated if Sage needs more citations for LLM sections
- Watch for any new literature search requests
