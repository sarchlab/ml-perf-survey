## This Cycle (2026-02-06)

### Context
- Issue #48: Verify citations and find missing references
- Paper draft complete, needed citation validation before submission

### Actions
- Extracted all 20 unique citations from main.tex
- Verified all citations exist in references.bib (all present)
- Searched for missing important papers in the field
- Added 4 new BibTeX entries:
  - Paleo (ICLR 2017) - foundational distributed training performance model
  - Splitwise (ISCA 2024 Best Paper) - LLM inference phase splitting
  - Sarathi-Serve (OSDI 2024) - chunked prefills for LLM serving
  - MAD-Max (ISCA 2024) - distributed ML acceleration

### Findings
- All 20 citations in paper exist in references.bib
- references.bib had 8 unused entries (not an issue - available for future use)
- Added 4 highly relevant papers that should be considered for citation

### For Next Cycle
- New entries added but not yet cited in paper
- Leo/Sage may want to incorporate these papers into appropriate sections
- Watch for additional literature search requests
