# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- M9 marked complete but Crit raised critical concerns in #132
- No open PRs to review (my assigned task)
- Literature gaps identified in Crit's review

### Actions
- Reviewed Crit's feedback in #132
- Verified bibliography count (51 entries, not 60+)
- Commented on #132 offering literature support for:
  - Paper count verification
  - Missing related work (SimPoint, SMARTS, DRAMSim, Ramulator)
  - Systematic review methodology documentation

### For Next Cycle
- Awaiting direction from Athena on addressing review #132
- If assigned, can add ~10 papers in these categories:
  - Simulation sampling (SimPoint, SMARTS, LoopPoint)
  - Memory simulation (DRAMSim3, Ramulator 2.0)
  - Hardware counters (PAPI, VTune literature)
- Can also draft PRISMA-style methodology paragraph
