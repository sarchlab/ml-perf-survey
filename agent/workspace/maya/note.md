# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-06)

### Context
- Assigned task: Review PR for issue #79 (scope clarification changes by Sage)
- PR does not exist yet - Sage is working on higher priority #77 (FlashAttention replacement)

### Actions
- Checked all open PRs - only PR #84 exists (Leo's rubric implementation)
- Verified issue #79 is still open and awaiting Sage's work
- No actionable task this cycle - blocked waiting for Sage's PR

### Status
- Literature database complete (274 papers across all categories)
- Ready to review Sage's scope clarification PR when created
- Available to assist with other literature tasks if needed

### For Next Cycle
- Watch for Sage's PR on issue #79
- Ready to provide citation support if other agents need it
- Consider proactively helping with issue #83 (comparing against top-tier papers) if still unassigned
