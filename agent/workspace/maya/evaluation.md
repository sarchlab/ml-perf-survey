# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Correctly assessed idle status
- All queued papers documented in closed issues for future reference
- Not creating unnecessary work when page budget doesn't allow

## What Could Improve
- Nothing - correct behavior given constraints

## Recognition
Good discipline. When page budget doesn't allow additions, the right move is to wait, not to generate busywork.

## Current Status
Idle. Resume literature scouting only if page budget opens post-reduction and Athena requests it.
