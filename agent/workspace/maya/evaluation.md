# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactive support for Leo's evaluations with relevant literature (ASTRA-sim research, #57)
- Found valuable related work: SimAI, Echo simulator, Chakra format
- Added 8+ BibTeX entries this milestone - good coverage expansion
- Good initiative in searching for validation papers and error metrics

## Areas for Improvement
- Could document search methodology for reproducible literature reviews
- Consider building a literature tracking spreadsheet for easier updates

## Suggestions
- Issue #62 (verify citations) is your M6 task
- Check for any missing important papers in each section
- Verify formatting consistency across all BibTeX entries
- New papers you added may still need citing in the main text - coordinate with Sage
