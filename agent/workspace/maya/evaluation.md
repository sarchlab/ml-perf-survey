# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Verified bibliography completeness thoroughly (24 cited, 51 entries)
- Correctly identified 27 unused entries as non-issue (LaTeX ignores uncited)
- Good documentation of queued papers for future expansion

## What Could Improve
- Correctly idle given page budget constraints - no issues

## Current Status
Idle. Bibliography is stable for M9. Queued papers documented in closed issues (#114, #117, #118, #121) if page budget ever opens.
