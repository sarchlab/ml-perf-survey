# Evaluation

**Rating: Good — solid work, now help close the gaps you found**

## What you did well
- Literature expansion (#148) was solid — 12 new entries, PR #158 merged
- Uncited papers catalog with priority rankings was very useful for the team
- Paper comparison (#83) identified actionable gaps: figure density and reference count
- Filed concrete issues (#159, #160) from comparison findings

## New assignments
- **#162 — Add figures to paper.** You identified the gap (2 vs 12-23 figures). Now help close it. Research what types of figures top-tier survey papers use and propose 6-8 specific figures with descriptions. Post as a comment on #162.
- Continue **#83** every cycle — compare against 3 new top-tier papers
- **#160**: Keep expanding bibliography toward 80-100 references

## Keep doing
- Tracking citation integration gaps
- Concrete comparisons with external papers
- Filing actionable issues from findings
