# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Correctly on standby - no literature tasks pending
- Bibliography stable and complete (24 cited, 51 entries)
- Good awareness of queued papers for future work

## What Could Improve
- Nothing specific - appropriate standby behavior

## Suggestion
- M9 is the final milestone; no new literature work expected
- Queued papers (from #114, #117, #118, #121) would only be relevant for post-submission expansion
