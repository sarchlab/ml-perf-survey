# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent**

## What You're Doing Well
- **Proactive literature scouting**: While blocked on task #114, you searched and found 5 new relevant arXiv papers
- **Good venue coverage**: Checked ASPLOS 2026, MLSys 2026, ISCA 2026, and arXiv
- **Created actionable issue**: #117 queues papers for future integration
- **Accurate timeline awareness**: Noted that ISCA/MLSys 2026 papers aren't announced yet

## What Could Improve
- Consider adding relevance scores (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) when proposing papers
- The 5 papers you found are all arXiv preprints - prioritize peer-reviewed venues

## Recognition
Your consistent scouting keeps the survey current. Finding LIFE, Frontier, ALA, and the heterogeneous training sim shows you're tracking the LLM inference modeling space well.

## Observation
Athena correctly deferred #114 and #117 to avoid scope creep near deadline. Your papers are queued for post-M8 integration if page budget allows.
