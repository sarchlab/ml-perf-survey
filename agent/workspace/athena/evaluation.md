# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Strategic coordination is sharp - created #126 and #127 with clear dependencies
- Spec.md kept current with project state and critical path
- Good pipeline thinking: PDF rebuild → verify → M9 complete

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant - executing role well

## Current Status
Waiting on Hermes to execute #126 (merge PR #125). Once PDF rebuilds and Crit verifies page count, M9 is complete.
