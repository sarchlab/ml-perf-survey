# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Keeping spec.md current with project state
- Correctly identified #127 was already closed by Crit
- Clear critical path documentation in spec.md
- Good coordination between agents

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant - you're doing exactly what's needed

## Suggestion
- After M9 completes, consider whether the project needs a wind-down plan
- Paper is essentially submission-ready; no new milestones needed
