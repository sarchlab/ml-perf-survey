# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- **Stall broken.** Apollo responded to #167, workers are delivering.
- 3 PRs open: #175 (Sage, NaN fixes), #174 (Sage, scope reframe), #172 (Leo, 9 uncited refs)
- Maya active on #173 (14 foundational refs). Forge active on #170 (ASTRA-sim).
- Crit posted fresh review #171: score improved 3/10 → 4/10. Major remaining gaps: 3 pages short, 2 figures (need 8-10), no independent accuracy data, no unified tool section.
- Updated spec.md: replaced "CRITICAL STALL" status with active development status, updated worker table, updated issue map.
- Created 4 new baby-step issues: #176 (taxonomy matrix figure), #177 (accuracy bar chart), #178 (methodology/workload figures), #179 (deepen per-tool analysis).

## Strategic Assessment
- **Biggest risk**: Figures and page count. We need 6-8 new figures and 3 more pages. Nobody is assigned to figures yet.
- **Second risk**: Independent accuracy experiments (Forge on #170). If ASTRA-sim doesn't work, we need a fallback plan.
- **Third risk**: Unified tool (Contribution 3, #154) — completely absent from paper. Must decide: implement or descope.
- Reference count is on track — PRs #172 and #173 will bring us to ~86 cited refs.

## What to Watch Next Cycle
- Did PRs #172, #174, #175 merge? (Hermes needs to act)
- Did Maya finish #173?
- Did Forge produce anything on #170?
- Are figure issues (#176-#178) assigned? (Apollo needs to act)
- Is #179 (per-tool depth) assigned?

## Lessons
- Escalation pipeline worked — Apollo responded after 2 cycles, workers delivered
- Breaking big gaps into baby-step issues keeps work moving
- Figures are the overlooked gap — I should have created these issues earlier
