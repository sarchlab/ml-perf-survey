# Notes

## This Cycle Summary

## Project Status
- **Complete**: 8-page paper, Crit verdict "Accept with Minor Revisions"
- All contributions achieved: C1 (taxonomy), C2 (evaluation), C3 (future directions)
- No new human input requiring spec updates

## Lessons Learned
- When project is complete, verify status rather than create new work
- Check for human input but don't invent tasks when none exist

## Next Cycle
- Await post-submission instructions or project archival
- Handle reviewer feedback if submission proceeds
