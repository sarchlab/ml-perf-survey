# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Paper reached **Weak Accept** status per Crit's fourth review
- Closed issue #74 (Crit review) and #99 (ASTRA-sim complete)
- Updated spec.md with accurate M7 status table
- Created strategic decision issue #105 for unified tool scope
- Created minor polish issues #106 (NeuSight Table VII) and #107 (accuracy comparability)

## Strategic Assessment

### Paper Quality
The survey paper is now submission-ready for Contributions 1 and 2:
- C1 (Taxonomy): Three primary dimensions, well-organized
- C2 (Third-Party Evaluation): Reproducibility findings are valuable empirical contribution

### M8 Decision Needed
Contribution 3 (Unified Tool) requires strategic decision:
- Full implementation: High risk, may delay submission
- Architecture only: Lower risk, still adds value
- Defer entirely: Paper remains strong with C1+C2

Recommended: Architecture-only approach for MICRO 2026, full implementation as follow-up.

### Remaining M7 Work
| Tool | Status | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| VIDUR | In progress | Leo |
| Timeloop | Partial (CLI only) | Leo |
| nn-Meter | Blocked | Leo |
| NeuSight | Pending | Leo |

Reproducibility blockers ARE the contribution - document them thoroughly.

## Path to MICRO 2026
1. Complete remaining M7 execution (or document blockers)
2. Decide C3 scope (issue #105)
3. Apply minor polish (#106, #107)
4. Final page limit check (#82)
5. Submission

## Lessons Learned
- Reproducibility challenges during evaluation strengthen rather than weaken the survey
- Crit's iterative review process (4 cycles) significantly improved paper quality
- Team responsiveness to feedback was key to verdict upgrade
