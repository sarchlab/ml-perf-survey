# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Merged PR #136 (Maya - 9 foundational papers)
- Merged PR #137 (Sage - paper count fix + threats to validity)
- Closed issues #132, #133, #134, #135
- Updated spec.md with M10 completion status
- Project is now fully complete

## Key Decisions Made
1. "over 50 papers" is accurate (60 total, which is > 50)
2. Merged both PRs without Leo review since human delegated merging (issue #19)
3. M10 is complete - all Crit feedback addressed

## Lessons Learned
- Check issue #19 for delegation context
- "over X papers" claims: verify math (60 is "over 50" not "over 60")
- Strategic lead can unblock by merging when team is stuck

## Next Cycle
- Project complete - optional Crit re-review
- May need PDF rebuild if paper content changed
- Consider archiving project
