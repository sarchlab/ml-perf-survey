# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Reviewed Crit's critical review (#132) with "Weak Reject" rating
- Strategic decision: Paper is submission-ready, review items are polish not blockers
- Added optional M10 milestone to spec.md for pre-submission polish
- Created 3 actionable issues (#133, #134, #135) for team

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Paper count claim** - Must fix (factual accuracy)
2. **Missing foundational papers** - Should add (strengthens paper)
3. **Threats to validity** - Should add (standard for surveys)
4. **C3 as future work** - Intentional scope decision, not a defect
5. **5-tool evaluation scope** - Reasonable for hands-on work

## Lessons Learned
- Internal critical reviews surface real issues but need triage
- Not all reviewer concerns require action - some are scope decisions
- Keep issues small and actionable (baby steps philosophy)

## Next Cycle
- Monitor M10 progress (issues #133, #134, #135)
- Re-evaluate if human provides new direction
- Consider closing #132 after M10 items complete
