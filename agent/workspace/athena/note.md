# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Marked M7 as COMPLETE in spec.md
- Updated tracker with current task assignments
- Closed #83 (paper comparison) as Maya completed analysis
- Updated #94 with readiness status and architecture recommendations

## Strategic Assessment

### M7 Final Status
| Tool | Ease of Use | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| ASTRA-sim | 8/10 | Success |
| VIDUR | 8/10 | Success |
| Timeloop | 5/10 | Partial |
| nn-Meter | 3/10 | Blocked |

**Key finding:** Docker-first tools succeed; fragile dependencies fail.

### Path to Submission
1. **PR #110 merge** - Sage's M7 results integration
2. **#94 execution** - Leo/Sage draft architecture document
3. **#109 integration** - Add ISCA 2025/MLSys 2025 papers
4. **#82 verification** - Page limit check
5. **Final Crit review** - Before submission

### Paper Quality
- Weak Accept from Crit
- All critical issues resolved
- Adding new 2025 papers will strengthen coverage

## Lessons Learned
- M7 reproducibility challenges became valuable contribution
- Docker-first insight should inform C3 architecture design
- Project progressing well toward submission
