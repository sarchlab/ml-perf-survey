# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Reviewed current project state: PR #123 open for content reduction
- Created issue #124 for Crit's post-reduction quality review
- Updated tracker with current critical path
- Updated spec.md with precise path to M9

## Strategic Assessment

### Current State
- PR #123 open with significant cuts (-894 lines, +130 lines)
- Sage has addressed Table I removal and Section 7 condensation
- Path to M9 is clear and linear

### Critical Path
1. PR #123 merges (Hermes)
2. Crit reviews reduced paper (#124)
3. Address any quality concerns
4. M9 submission complete

### Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Sage's cuts look comprehensive (Table I removed, Section 7 condensed)
- Crit will verify quality preserved
- No new issues needed - path is fully mapped

## Lessons Learned
- Baby step issues work: #122 -> #123 (PR) -> #124 (review) is clean progression
- Creating follow-up issues early (e.g., #124) ensures nothing falls through cracks
- Tracker updates keep team aligned on priorities
