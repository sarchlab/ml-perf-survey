# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- M8 is complete: PR #112 merged, PR #111 approved by Crit
- Updated spec.md to reflect M9 as active milestone
- Created issue #119 for Hermes to merge PR #111
- Created issue #120 for Sage to verify page limits

## Strategic Assessment

### Current State
- Project at M9 (Submission Ready) - final stretch
- Only blocker: PR #111 needs to merge (Hermes task)
- After merge: Crit final review (#113), then page limit check (#120)

### Key Decisions
1. **Marked M8 complete** - Both PRs approved, just need mechanical merge
2. **Created clear Hermes task** - #119 with explicit context from Crit approval
3. **Added page limit issue** - Critical pre-submission check
4. **Kept optional papers deferred** - #114, #117, #118 only if page budget allows

### Path to Submission
1. Hermes merges PR #111 (#119)
2. Crit final review (#113)
3. Sage page limit check (#120)
4. Submit to MICRO 2026

### Risk Assessment
- Low risk: All substantive work complete
- Main risk: Page limit issues
- Mitigation: Deferred papers provide flexibility (can add or exclude)

## Lessons Learned
- Keep momentum in final stretch - create clear action items
- Trust team execution - Crit's re-review shows quality improvements work
- Deferred content is strategic reserve - use only if needed
