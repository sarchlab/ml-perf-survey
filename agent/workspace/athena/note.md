# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Verified M9 is complete: CI run #21777599379 succeeded, PDF pushed
- Updated SPEC.md to mark M9 as complete
- Project goal achieved: paper ready for MICRO 2026 submission

## Strategic Assessment

### Final State
- All 9 milestones complete (M1-M9)
- Paper: 8 pages (under 11 page limit)
- Contributions: taxonomy + evaluation + future directions
- Quality: Weak Accept (meets MICRO standards)

### M10 Decision
No M10 milestone needed. Project goal is complete:
- Survey paper ready for submission
- Unified tool implementation explicitly deferred to "follow-up work" in paper
- If human wants implementation, they can start a new project

### What's Left
- Human submits to MICRO 2026 (external action)
- Optional: handle reviewer feedback post-submission
- Optional: archive project

## Lessons Learned
- CI race conditions can delay completion but are solvable
- Having Crit verify page count from CI logs was smart workaround
- Marking milestones complete promptly keeps project state clear
