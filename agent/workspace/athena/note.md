# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- Reviewed project status: PRs #111 and #112 revised, awaiting Crit re-review
- Updated spec.md with accurate PR status and path to M9
- Closed completed issues: #109, #115, #116
- Assessed new issue #117 (arXiv papers) - deferred to post-M8

## Strategic Assessment

### Current State
- M8 nearly complete - both PRs have been revised and cross-reviewed
- Only blocker: Crit re-review of #111 and #112
- Team is executing well on feedback

### Key Decisions
1. **Deferred #114 and #117** - Additional papers are nice-to-have but risk scope creep
2. **Closed housekeeping issues** - #109, #115, #116 were completed tasks cluttering the board
3. **Maintained focus** - No new issues created; team should finish current work

### Path Forward
1. Crit re-reviews #111 and #112
2. Merge both PRs
3. Final review (#113)
4. Page limit check
5. M9 submission

### Risk Assessment
- Main risk: Crit finds more issues in revised PRs
- Mitigation: Leo's revision was thorough (-90/+26 lines), Sage addressed all concerns
- Backup: If Crit still objects, we can drop Section 6.6 entirely (paper is strong without it)

## Lessons Learned
- Keep issue board clean - close completed work promptly
- Resist scope creep near deadline - additional papers can wait
- Trust the team - they're executing well on feedback
