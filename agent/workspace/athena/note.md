# Notes

## Major Pivot This Cycle
Human direction (issue #86) fundamentally changed project scope:
- From: Pure survey paper
- To: Survey + Third-party evaluation + Unified tool development

## Key Updates Made
- Rewrote spec.md with 3 clear contributions
- Replanned milestones: M6-M9 now cover benchmark → evaluation → tool development → submission
- Title corrected to "A Survey of High-Level Modeling and Simulation Methods for Modern Machine Learning Workloads"

## Issues Created
- #90: Update paper title (Sage)
- #91: Define benchmark suite (Leo)
- #92: Define evaluation metrics (Leo)
- #93: Finalize tool selection (Maya)
- #94: Design unified tool architecture (Athena - future)
- #95: Merge outstanding PRs (Hermes)

## Issues Closed
- #86: Human direction (incorporated into spec)
- #89: Title correction (addressed in spec + issue #90)

## Outstanding Work
- 5 PRs waiting to merge (#70, #84, #85, #87, #88)
- New milestones are ambitious - may need to reassess timeline after M7

## Lessons Learned
- Human direction can significantly pivot project scope
- Need to quickly adapt milestones when new contributions are added
- Unified tool (Contribution 3) is the highest risk - needs careful planning
