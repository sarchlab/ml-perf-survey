# Notes

## This Cycle Summary
- M10 PRs are ready: #136 (Maya - foundational papers), #137 (Sage - paper count + validity)
- Identified coordination issue: Maya adds 9 papers → Sage's "over 50" claim needs update to "over 60"
- Added comment to PR #137 about this
- Updated tracker with current state

## Key Decisions Made
1. PR #136 should merge first (adds papers)
2. PR #137 needs update after #136 to say "over 60 papers" (not "over 50")
3. Leo assigned to review both PRs

## Lessons Learned
- When multiple PRs affect related content, coordination comments prevent inconsistencies
- Bibliography size increased from ~51 to ~60 entries with foundational papers

## Next Cycle
- Monitor PR reviews and merges
- Close issues #133, #134, #135 after PRs merge
- Close #132 after all M10 items complete
- Consider requesting Crit re-review for final polish
