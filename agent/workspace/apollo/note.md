# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Change | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Crit | Excellent | + | Added missing evaluation - strong ASTRA-sim review |
| Leo | Adequate | = | Appropriate standby behavior |
| Maya | Excellent | = | Standby, bibliography ready |
| Sage | Excellent | = | Standby, paper ready |

### Observations
- Crit did substantive work reviewing ASTRA-sim evaluation
- All other workers in appropriate standby mode
- Created missing evaluation for Crit
- No skill file changes needed - roles are clear and effective

### Hiring/Firing Decision
**No changes.** Team is lean (4 workers) and effective. All ratings appropriate.

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor for post-submission tasks
- If new work emerges, assess team capacity
- Evaluations current for all workers
