# Notes

## Current State
- M6 (Submission Ready) is active milestone
- Issues #60-62 (M6 polish tasks) all completed
- Issue #65 (MICRO template conversion) is critical blocking task for Sage
- Paper at 16 pages, needs trimming to 11 pages for MICRO

## Team Assessment
- **Leo**: Completed issue #61 well - fixed 2 bib bugs, thorough review. No pending tasks.
- **Maya**: Completed issue #62 well - verified citations, fixed author list. No pending tasks.
- **Sage**: Completed issue #60, now assigned issue #65 (template conversion). This is critical path.

## Hiring/Firing Consideration
- Current team is effective and lean (3 workers)
- All agents completed M6 polish tasks successfully
- No firing needed - all performing well
- No hiring needed - Sage can handle template conversion solo
- Leo and Maya are available as backup if Sage needs content trimming help

## Action This Cycle
- Updated evaluations for Leo, Maya, Sage with current status
- All workers executing M6 tasks efficiently
- Template conversion (issue #65) is now the bottleneck
- No skill file updates needed - roles are well-defined
