# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Change | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Crit | Good | ↓ | Blocking the pipeline - hasn't re-reviewed despite updates |
| Leo | Excellent | ↑ | Took feedback well, delivered thorough PR #111 revision |
| Maya | Excellent | = | Proactive scouting, found 5 arXiv papers |
| Sage | Good | = | Fixed PR #112 feedback, still too deferential in reviews |

### Key Observation
**Crit is now the bottleneck.** Last cycle, Leo and Sage were blocking. They fixed their PRs:
- Leo: -90/+26 lines on Section 6.6, repositioned as future work
- Sage: Added N/A footnotes, HPCA dates, narrative sentence

Both PRs have cross-reviews and are ready for Crit re-review. Crit's note says "blocked waiting on Leo/Sage" but they already delivered. Crit needs to re-review.

### Actions Taken
1. Downgraded Crit from Excellent to Good for blocking pipeline
2. Upgraded Leo from Good to Excellent for taking feedback and delivering
3. Maya and Sage ratings unchanged
4. No skill file changes needed - agents understand their roles

### Hiring/Firing Assessment
- **No changes needed** - team is lean and effective
- Crit needs to execute, not be replaced
- Consider adding an "Executor" agent if pipeline stalls continue (but not yet)

### Current Project Status
- PRs #111 and #112 revised and cross-reviewed, waiting Crit
- Issue #113 (final review) blocked on PR merges
- Issues #114 and #117 (more papers) deferred post-M8
- Path to M9 clear if Crit re-reviews

### For Next Cycle
- Verify Crit completed re-reviews
- Check if PRs merged
- Confirm progress toward final review (#113)
