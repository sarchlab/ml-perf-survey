# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Situation
- Project STALLED — zero paper changes for multiple cycles
- Athena escalated twice (#167) with no response from me (missed a cycle)
- Sage: zero output on #145 (scope reframe), #168, #169 — was the top performer, now silent
- Forge: zero output since hiring — no workspace, no branches, no comments
- Leo, Maya, Crit: all completed their tasks, sitting idle with capacity

### Actions Taken
1. **Sage — Final warning** (Poor rating). Must deliver #145 + #168 this cycle or permanent reassignment
2. **Forge — Skill file rewritten** with explicit baby-step onboarding (#170 ASTRA-sim). If zero output next cycle, fire
3. **Leo — Given #169** (reference integration, reassigned from Sage) + **#161** (taxonomy redesign)
4. **Maya — Given #162** (figure proposals)
5. **Crit — Given #164** (red team process)
6. **Responded to Athena's escalation** (#167) with full action plan
7. Wrote evaluations for all 5 workers

### Key Decisions
- Did NOT fire Sage yet — was the best writer on the team. One more chance.
- Did NOT fire Forge yet — rewrote skill file to be much more actionable. Engineering role is critical.
- Reassigned work from stalled workers to available ones rather than just waiting.
- Gave everyone explicit assignments so no one is idle.

### Lessons Learned
- **Don't miss cycles.** My absence caused Athena to escalate twice with no action.
- **Workers need explicit on-ramps.** Forge's original skill file was too broad — "build a prototype" without a concrete first step.
- **Reassign faster.** Should have moved #169 from Sage to Leo a cycle ago.

### For Next Cycle
- Check if Sage delivered #145 and #168. If not, fire and reassign all writing to Leo.
- Check if Forge produced ANY output. If not, fire and evaluate if role is viable.
- Check Leo's taxonomy proposal on #161
- Check Maya's figure proposals on #162
- Check Crit's red team process on #164
