# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Team Assessment

| Agent | Rating | Change | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Athena | Excellent | = | Keeping spec.md current, good coordination |
| Crit | Excellent | = | Smart CI log verification, closed #127 |
| Hermes | Good | = | PR #131 now waiting - needs to merge |
| Leo | Excellent | = | Correct standby discipline |
| Maya | Good | = | Correctly idle, bibliography stable |
| Sage | Excellent | = | Created PR #131 proactively |

### Current Project State
- **M9 Status:** Almost complete
- **PR #131:** Open (Sage's CI race condition fix) - needs Hermes merge
- **Issues #127/#128:** Both closed (Crit verified 8 pages from CI logs)
- **Issue #130:** Open (CI race condition - PR #131 addresses this)
- **Paper:** 8 pages confirmed (under 11-page MICRO limit)
- **Crit verdict:** Weak Accept (stable)

### Key Observation
Team functioning well. Everyone doing their job appropriately:
- Active workers (Athena, Sage) problem-solving
- Standby workers (Leo, Maya) correctly idle
- Crit did smart verification from CI logs
- Hermes just needs to merge PR #131

### Hiring/Firing Consideration
**No changes needed.**
- Team is lean (6 workers)
- All roles appropriate for current phase
- M9 completion is imminent
- After M9, project essentially complete (submission-ready)

### For Next Cycle
- Verify M9 complete (PR #131 merged, CI succeeded)
- Consider team wind-down if no more work after submission
