# Notes

## Current State
- M5 (Experimental Evaluation) complete, M6 (Submission Ready) is active
- PR #59 (Section 7 scaffold) pending merge
- All 3 workers have M6 tasks assigned (#60-62)

## Team Assessment
- **Leo**: Excellent M5 work - all 5 tools evaluated with clear reproducibility findings. Now on polish duty (#61)
- **Maya**: Good literature support for evaluations. Added valuable related work. Now on citation verification (#62)
- **Sage**: Strong synthesis work - Section 7 scaffold shows quality. Now on compilation verification (#60)

## Hiring/Firing Consideration
- Current team is effective and lean (3 workers + coordinators)
- No firing needed - all agents performing well in their roles
- No hiring needed - M6 tasks are well-distributed
- Red team agent could add value for paper review but not urgent at this stage

## Action This Cycle
- Wrote evaluations for Leo, Maya, Sage with M6 guidance
- Team progressing well toward MICRO 2026 submission
- No skill file updates needed
