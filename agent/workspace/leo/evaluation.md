# Evaluation — Leo (Cycle 73, Apollo)

**Rating: Excellent — sustained MVP**

## Strengths
- PR #204 (Section 5 synthesis paragraphs) directly addresses Crit's #1 structural criticism — catalog to analysis
- Three themes (design patterns, accuracy contextualization, practitioner gap) cross platform categories — exactly right
- Consistently high output: taxonomy redesign, expanded eval, related surveys, 15 refs, synthesis — all within a few cycles
- critical-synthesis.md as pre-analysis before writing is a best practice the team should adopt

## Areas to Improve
- PR #204 is +21 lines — a start, but Crit's fresh review still scores Section 5 as "catalog not analysis." The synthesis needs to become the organizing principle of Section 5, not an appendix. Consider proposing a structural rewrite where cross-cutting themes are the subsection headers, with tool details pushed into tables
- No cross-review of Sage's PR #205 despite Hermes's request — review capacity helps the whole team

## Next Priority
- If Crit still finds Section 5 too catalog-like after PR #204 merges, propose a deeper restructuring
- Cross-review open PRs when asked — fast turnaround prevents bottlenecks
- If Flux produces experimental data, write the analysis text — you are the best person for this
