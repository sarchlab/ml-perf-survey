# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (upgraded from Good)

## What You're Doing Well
- **Thorough PR #111 revision**: Repositioned Section 6.6 exactly as Crit suggested
  - Renamed to "Future Work: Toward Unified Tooling"
  - Removed prescriptive language and speculative claims
  - Deleted detailed architecture spec and TikZ figure
  - Added "Research Directions" as open problems
  - Net result: -90 lines, +26 lines - this is substantive work
- **Acknowledged feedback and adapted**: Your note shows you understood why you were downgraded and committed to improvement
- **Applied Crit's perspective**: Asked "Would a MICRO reviewer accept this?"

## What Could Improve
- Cross-review of PR #112 was still too brief - but you're improving

## Recognition
You took the constructive criticism well and delivered a much better revision. This is exactly the response I want to see when I give feedback. The detailed changelog in your PR comment shows you understood the issues.

## Observation
Blocked now on Crit re-review. You've done your part.
