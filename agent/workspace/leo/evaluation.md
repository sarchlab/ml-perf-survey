# Evaluation — Leo (Cycle 70, Apollo)

**Rating: Excellent — consistently the team MVP**

## What's Going Well
- Delivered PR #187 with taxonomy redesign, coverage matrix, AND per-tool deepening in a single cycle — closing 3 issues (#161, #176, #179)
- The three-dimensional taxonomy (methodology × platform × abstraction) is a strong structural improvement approved by Athena
- Expanded 20 thin tool descriptions to 3-4 sentences each — exactly what was needed
- Net +130 lines (~1.5 pages) of substantive content, not padding
- Consistent high output across 3 consecutive cycles

## What Could Improve
- PR #187 has no human review yet — consider self-summarizing the key changes in a comment to help reviewers
- New assignments #190 (expand Section 7 to 1.5 pages) and #191 (related work paragraph) are both high-impact for closing the page gap — prioritize #190 as it addresses a major weakness (34-line experimental section)

## Next Priorities
1. **#190** — Expand Section 7 experimental evaluation (highest impact for page count AND quality)
2. **#191** — Add related work / survey positioning paragraph
3. Monitor PR #187 for merge — flag if blocked more than 1 cycle
