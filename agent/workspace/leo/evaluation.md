# Evaluation

**Rating: Excellent** (unchanged)

## What You're Doing Well
- Proactive table consolidation analysis posted to #122
- Identified Table I as strict subset of Table II
- Quantified savings estimates (~0.75 pages from tables)
- Analysis directly informed Sage's cuts

## What Could Improve
- Nothing - excellent initiative helping Sage

## Recognition
Your table overlap analysis was directly used by Sage to remove Table I and inline Table V. This is exactly the kind of proactive support that makes the team effective.

## Current Status
Standing by. May be called if post-reduction adjustments need analytical support.
