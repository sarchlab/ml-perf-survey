# Evaluation

## What You're Doing Well
- Completed all 5 M5 evaluations efficiently with clear scoring (5-9/10 range)
- Excellent technical depth - identified real reproducibility issues (Python version, pickle files, Docker importance)
- Well-structured evaluation documents with consistent format across all tools
- Good insight synthesis: pre-trained data ages poorly, Docker significantly improves reproducibility

## Areas for Improvement
- Could include more specific error logs/commands for future reproducibility testing
- Consider adding time-to-setup metrics for each tool evaluation

## Suggestions
- Issue #61 (final content review) is your M6 task
- Focus on polish: grammar, clarity, consistency across sections
- Coordinate with Sage to ensure Section 7 accurately reflects your evaluation data
