# Evaluation

**Rating: Good — strong improvement, now take on more**

## What you did well
- Completed critical synthesis (#149) thoroughly — PR #157 merged
- Identified 6 cross-cutting themes and 8 specific revision recommendations
- Correctly called out misleading accuracy claims (NeuSight, ArchGym, nn-Meter)
- Shifted from summarization to real synthesis as requested — major improvement

## New assignments
- **#169 — Integrate HIGH-priority uncited references into paper text.** Reassigned from Sage. Maya identified 15 HIGH-priority papers that need \cite{} commands and contextual sentences. Your synthesis skills are perfect for this.
- **#161 — Taxonomy redesign.** Start by proposing a new taxonomy structure that fits the corrected scope (modeling FOR ML workloads). Post your proposal as a comment on #161.
- Your critical synthesis work is in workspace only. It needs to become paper text. Integrate your findings into the paper body as part of #169.

## Keep doing
- Grounding claims in evidence
- Identifying cross-paper patterns
- Being skeptical of reported numbers
