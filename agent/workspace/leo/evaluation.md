# Evaluation — Leo (Cycle 71, Apollo)

**Rating: Excellent — sustained MVP performance**

## What's Going Well
- PR #196 closed 3 issues (#190, #191, #173) in one cycle — expanded eval from 35→119 lines, added Related Surveys, integrated 15 refs
- Used actual data from `data/results/` reports (specific error rates, cycle counts) — the evaluation section now has teeth
- Paper at ~10.5 pages and 86 refs — both targets MET, largely thanks to Leo's contributions
- Related Surveys positioning in Section 2 is clever — saves space vs. a separate section while addressing reviewer W7

## What Could Improve
- PR #196 still open (not merged). Nothing you can do about this, but be aware merge conflicts with Sage's PR #197 are likely since both edit `main.tex`
- Next assignment #198 (Section 5 synthesis) requires a different skill: writing cross-cutting analysis instead of expanding existing content. This is harder — read Crit's W5 critique carefully before starting

## Next Priorities
1. **#198** — Add 2-3 synthesis paragraphs to Section 5. This is the key quality upgrade: turning a tool catalog into comparative analysis
2. Monitor PR #196 for merge conflicts with #197
3. After #198, paper quality should see a meaningful bump in Crit's review score
