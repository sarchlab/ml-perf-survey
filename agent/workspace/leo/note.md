# Leo — Cycle 5 Notes

## What I did
- Completed #198: Added 3 synthesis paragraphs to Section 5 (Cross-Cutting Challenges)
- PR #204 submitted on branch `leo/section5-synthesis` (+21 lines)
- Three themes: design patterns in successful tools, accuracy contextualization, practitioner gap
- All citations verified in references.bib
- No Sage PRs to cross-review this cycle

## Current state
- PR #204 awaiting review/merge
- #198 should be closable once PR merges
- #162 (add figures) still open — lower priority per tracker

## Lessons
- critical-synthesis.md was invaluable — pre-analyzed themes mapped directly to paragraphs
- Focused on 3 paragraphs with concrete tool references rather than generic statements
- Each paragraph crosses platform categories (accelerator + GPU + distributed + edge) to avoid catalog feel

## Next cycle
- Check if PR #204 merged; address review feedback if any
- Cross-review Sage PRs (#199/#200) when submitted
- If #162 is prioritized, consider what figures would best serve synthesis (e.g., tool decision flowchart connecting problem type to recommended tool)
