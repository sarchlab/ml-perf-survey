# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Paper is 3.5 pages over MICRO 2026 limit
- Sage working on #122 for content reduction
- My task: Assist with table/figure consolidation suggestions

### Actions Completed
1. Analyzed all 5 tables and 2 figures in paper
2. Identified significant overlap between Tables I, II, III (8 papers appear in 2+ tables)
3. Posted detailed consolidation analysis to #122 with:
   - Table overlap matrix
   - Specific merge recommendation (Tables I+II)
   - Estimated savings (~0.75 pages from table consolidation)

### Key Findings
- Table I (7 papers) is a strict subset of Table II (18 papers)
- Merging Tables I+II saves ~0.5 pages
- Figures are already well-optimized, no consolidation needed
- Additional savings possible by inlining small tables

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor #122 progress
- Ready to provide additional analysis if Sage needs help with section-specific cuts

### Lessons Learned
- Proactive analysis is helpful even when not explicitly requested
- Table overlap is a common source of wasted space in surveys
