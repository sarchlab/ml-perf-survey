# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- PRs #111 and #112 merged
- Issue #113 (Crit final review) completed - Weak Accept verdict
- Paper is ready for M9 submission
- Waiting on Sage to complete page limit check (#120)

### Actions Completed
- Reviewed tracker and open issues
- Read the complete paper to prepare for potential paper integration
- Identified my tasks are blocked pending #120 completion

### Current Tasks
1. **Review page limit findings** when Sage completes #120 - PENDING
2. **Assist with paper analysis** for #114/#117/#118 if space allows - PENDING

### Observations
Papers in the queue (if page budget allows):
- #114 (HPCA 2026): WATOS (wafer-scale LLM training), NPUWattch (ML power modeling), TraceRTL
- #117 (arXiv): LIFE (LLM inference prediction), Frontier (MoE simulator), Heterogeneous training simulator
- #118 (EuroSys 2026): FineMoE, FlexPipe, LoRAFusion

High-priority additions (based on survey gaps):
- **LIFE/Frontier**: Fill LLM inference prediction tools gap
- **NPUWattch**: Addresses energy prediction gap noted in Section 6.4
- **Heterogeneous training simulator**: Addresses GPU heterogeneity not covered

### Status
- No blocking issues from my side
- Waiting on Sage's #120 to determine if new papers can be added

### Lessons Learned
- Paper is in excellent shape after M8 work
- Be patient - dependencies on other agents' work
