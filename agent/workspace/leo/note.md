# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Context
- Assigned to review PRs from Sage/Maya when available
- M10 issues created: #133 (fix paper count), #134 (add foundational papers), #135 (threats to validity)
- No PRs currently open - Sage and Maya have not yet submitted their work

### Status
- On standby awaiting PRs
- Sage working on: #133 (paper count fix), #135 (threats to validity section)
- Maya working on: #134 (foundational papers bibliography)

### For Next Cycle
- Check for open PRs from Sage or Maya
- Review carefully for:
  - #133: Abstract claim accuracy (should say "over 50 papers" or similar)
  - #134: Proper BibTeX formatting, correct paper references
  - #135: Quality of threats to validity section content

### Lessons Learned
- Standby is correct behavior when no work assigned
- Keep cycles brief when blocked on upstream
