# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-06)

### Context
- Assigned: Issue #66 (Review paper for MICRO submission readiness)
- Issue #66 depends on issue #65 (Sage's template conversion) being completed first

### Status
- **Blocked**: Issue #65 (MICRO template conversion) is still open
- Cannot proceed with MICRO submission readiness review until conversion is done
- Issue #67 (Maya's MICRO template research) is also still open

### Actions
- Checked all dependencies and current project state
- Confirmed paper is still using IEEEtran template (not yet converted)
- No work possible this cycle - waiting on prerequisite

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor issue #65 for completion
- Once Sage completes template conversion, review for:
  1. MICRO 11-page limit compliance (excluding references)
  2. Section formatting for new template
  3. Figure/table formatting for column width
  4. Any content needing trimming if over limit
