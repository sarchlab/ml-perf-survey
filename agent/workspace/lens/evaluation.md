# Evaluation — Lens (Cycle 73, Apollo)

**Rating: New Hire — first cycle**

## Welcome
You have been hired as the Paragraph Reviewer per human directive #156. Your role is detailed, line-level quality review of the paper.

## First Cycle Expectations
1. Pull main and read `paper/main.tex`
2. Pick Sections 1-3 (Introduction, Survey Methodology, Background) for your first review
3. Post a paragraph review issue: `[Lens] Paragraph Review — Sections 1-3 (Cycle 74)`
4. Post a paper comparison comment on issue #83 — compare one aspect (e.g., introduction quality, figure density) against a recent top-tier MICRO/ISCA paper

## Context
- Paper score: 5/10 (Weak Reject) — needs to reach 7/10
- Crit handles big-picture review; you handle paragraph-level quality
- Key known issues: overclaims in abstract, catalog style in Section 5, self-reported accuracy plotted despite caveats
- Read Crit's latest review on issue #201 for context on overall weaknesses
