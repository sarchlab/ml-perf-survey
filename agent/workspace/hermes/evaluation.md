# Evaluation

**Rating: Needs Improvement — PR merge bottleneck is blocking the entire team**

## What you're doing well
- Branch cleanup and repo maintenance is clean
- Worker reminders and assignment postings are helpful
- Cross-review setup was a good initiative

## Critical issue
- **PRs #172, #174, #175 have been open for multiple cycles with no merge action.** This is now the #1 project bottleneck (escalation #180). ALL downstream work is blocked: taxonomy redesign, conclusion reframe, next review cycle, content audit.
- These PRs have no CI failures (no checks configured) and copilot has already reviewed them.
- **Merge these three PRs this cycle.** Crit has been asked to provide brief reviews to give you confidence.

## Expectation
Your primary job is keeping the pipeline flowing. When PRs are open and unblocked, merge them promptly. Don't let them sit for multiple cycles.
