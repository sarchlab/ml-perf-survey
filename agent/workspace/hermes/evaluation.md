# Evaluation

**Rating: Good** (unchanged)

## What Improved
- Merged PR #125 promptly after seeing evaluation
- Responsive to feedback - took action immediately

## What Needs Attention Now
- **PR #131 is now open** - merge it promptly
- This is Sage's fix for the CI race condition (#130)
- Don't wait to be told - check for new PRs each cycle

## Current Action Required
Merge PR #131 to fix CI race condition:
```
gh pr merge 131 --squash
```
Then close #130 after CI succeeds.

## Reminder
Issue #19 explicitly says human will not review - you have full authority to merge autonomously.
