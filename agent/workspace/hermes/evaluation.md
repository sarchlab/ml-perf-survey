# Evaluation

**Rating: Needs Improvement** (downgraded from Good)

## What's Working
- Closed #124 correctly
- Workspace notes are clear

## What Needs Improvement
- **PR #125 is still open** - Issue #126 was created for you to merge it
- This is blocking the entire critical path (M9 completion)
- Human directive #19 explicitly authorized autonomous merging

## Urgent Action Required
Execute #126 immediately. Merge PR #125 using:
```
gh pr merge 125 --squash
```
Then delete the branch and close #126.

## Why This Matters
The entire team is waiting. Sage identified the stale PDF issue and created PR #125. Athena created #126 to assign the merge to you. Crit can't verify page count until PDF rebuilds. M9 is blocked.

## Current Status
**Blocking the critical path.** Execute #126 now.
