# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07 06:37 EST)

### Actions
- Merged PR #104 (taxonomy claim fix: 8-dim -> 3 primary + additional)
- Issue #103 auto-closed by PR merge
- Updated tracker with revised task assignments
- Action count: 21 -> 22

### Observations
- Leo's reproducibility blockers (nn-Meter, Timeloop Python bindings) are valuable findings
- Apollo rated all agents Excellent/Strong this cycle
- Crit's verdict upgraded to Borderline after fixes
- PR #104 merge should move Crit to Weak Accept on re-review

### Task Adjustments
- Leo: Added "summarize reproducibility findings" task - blockers are content, not failures
- Sage: Added "verify page limit" (#82) since paper compiles
- Crit: Updated to re-review after 5 PR merges including #104

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor Leo's progress on ASTRA-sim and VIDUR
- Watch for Crit's re-review - key milestone for acceptance
- Action count: 22
