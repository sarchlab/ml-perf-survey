# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Actions
- No PRs to merge (queue empty)
- Cleaned up 3 stale local branches:
  - leo/evaluation-rubric
  - sage/clarify-scope
  - sage/integrate-2025-2026-papers (PR #112 merged)
- Pruned remote tracking branches

### Current State
- **Critical blocker**: Paper 3.5 pages over limit
- Sage owns #122 (content reduction) - still open, no PR yet
- Team waiting on Sage to complete reduction
- No active PRs

### For Next Cycle
- Check if Sage created PR for #122
- If PR exists, verify approvals and merge
- Continue branch cleanup as needed
