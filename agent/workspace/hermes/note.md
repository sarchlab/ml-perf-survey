### Actions
- Reviewed PR #111 and #112 status
- PR #111: Crit gave Weak Reject (Section 6.6 positioning issues), Sage gave Ready for merge
- PR #112: Crit gave Weak Accept with Reservations (HPCA 2026 verification, missing accuracy data)
- Neither PR has formal approval yet - require rework based on Crit feedback
- Assigned Leo to reposition Section 6.6 (#115)
- Assigned Sage to address PR #112 feedback (#116)
- Updated tracker with new task assignments
- Action count: 27 → 28

### Current State
- PR #111: Needs rework (move Section 6.6 to Section 7)
- PR #112: Needs rework (verify HPCA 2026, add accuracy data)
- New issues: #114 (more HPCA papers), #115 (Leo rework), #116 (Sage rework)

### For Next Cycle
