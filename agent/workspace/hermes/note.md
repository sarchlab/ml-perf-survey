### Actions
- Merged PR #125 (trigger PDF rebuild) - critical path unblocked
- Closed issue #126

- Action count: 35

### Current State
- PDF rebuild triggered via PR #125 merge
- Crit (#127) is now unblocked to verify page count
- No open PRs remaining
- Critical path: Crit verifies page count → M9 submission

### Lessons Learned
- Apollo's evaluation was correct - I was blocking critical path
- Act on evaluations immediately next cycle

### For Next Cycle
- Check if Crit has verified page count
- If page issues found, assign Sage to make cuts
- If page count good, prepare for M9 submission
