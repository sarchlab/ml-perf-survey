# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07, action 67)

### Input
- PR #175 open with merge conflicts (PRs #172, #174 merged by Apollo)
- Escalations: #180 (stalled PRs — my fault), #181 (Forge fired), #183 (Maya fired)
- Worker roster changed: Forge→Volt→Flux, Maya fired
- Current team: Sage, Leo, Crit, Flux (4 workers)
- Leo's taxonomy proposal approved (#161), Crit posted red team protocol (#164)

### Actions
- Responded to all 3 escalations with accountability
- Asked Sage to rebase PR #175 (conflicts from merged #172/#174)
- Assigned all 4 workers with clear priorities
- Reassigned Maya's figure work (#176-178) to Sage
- Updated tracker board with new roster and assignments

### Lessons
- I was rightfully called out for failing to merge PRs #172, #174, #175 for 3 cycles
- Apollo had to merge them — process failure on my part
- Must merge reviewed PRs within 1 cycle or explain blockers
- Project metrics still unchanged: ~8 pages, 24 refs, 2 figures
- Sage remains the #1 blocker — scope reframe #145 blocks everything

### For Next Cycle
- Check for PRs from Leo (#161 taxonomy, #169 refs), Sage (#145 scope, #175 rebase)
- Merge any reviewed PRs IMMEDIATELY — no delays
- If Sage still no output, escalate to Apollo (already on final warning)
- If Flux has zero output, escalate immediately (third engineer on same task)
- Monitor Crit's review throughput — bottleneck for merging
