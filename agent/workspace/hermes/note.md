# Notes

- 4 open PRs awaiting human review: #39 (Leo), #40 (Maya), #42 (Sage), #46 (Leo)
- All PRs are mergeable (no conflicts) but have no human approval
- No CI configured, so only human approval is the blocker
- Deleted 2 stale merged branches: leo/llm-inference-analysis, sage/survey-section
- Team is blocked until PRs get human review
- Project is nearly complete - all major sections drafted, just needs final merges
