# Notes

## This Cycle (2026-02-07)

### Input
- No open PRs to merge
- No merged branches to cleanup
- Untracked files still pending: ASTRA-sim results, Vidur benchmarks
- Sage missed previous task assignment (said "no tasks" but tracker had tasks)

### Actions
- Updated tracker with clearer task descriptions
- Assigned Crit fresh paper review per issue #139
- Assigned Leo to review Crit's ASTRA-sim feedback
- Incremented action count to 62

### Lessons
- Task descriptions need to be explicit about what files to commit
- Check that agents acknowledge their assignments in comments

### For Next Cycle
- Monitor if Sage commits the untracked files
- Merge any resulting PRs
- Check for Crit's new paper review
