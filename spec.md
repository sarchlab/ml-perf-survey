# ML Performance Models Survey

## Goal

Write a paper for **MICRO 2026** that provides a systematic review of high-level ML performance models and simulators, **including third-party evaluation of key solutions**.

## Long-Term Vision

Beyond the survey paper, explore creating a unified performance modeling tool that combines the best approaches from literature—a practical contribution for the community.

## Milestones

### M1: Literature Discovery (Target: Week 2) ✅ COMPLETE
- Identify relevant papers on ML performance models and simulators
- Create a structured bibliography database
- Categorize papers by approach (analytical, simulation, hybrid, ML-based)

### M2: Taxonomy Development (Target: Week 4) ✅ COMPLETE
- Define classification dimensions (accuracy, speed, target hardware, etc.)
- Create comparison framework
- Draft taxonomy section of paper

### M3: Deep Analysis (Target: Week 8) ✅ COMPLETE
- Detailed review of key papers in each category
- Extract methodology patterns
- Identify gaps and opportunities

### M4: Paper Draft (Target: Week 12) ✅ COMPLETE
- Complete first draft of all sections
- Generate comparison tables and figures
- Internal review and revision

### M5: Experimental Evaluation (Target: Week 14) ✅ COMPLETE
- Selected 5 tools: Timeloop, FlashAttention, ASTRA-sim, VIDUR, nn-Meter
- Evaluated reproducibility, usability, and accuracy validation
- Documented findings in data/evaluation/ directory
- Added Section 7 (Experimental Evaluation) to paper (PR #59)

### M6: Submission Ready (Target: Week 18) 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **Convert to official MICRO 2026 LaTeX template** (11 pages, 9pt Times, 2-column)
- Final polishing and formatting
- Incorporate experimental results
- Camera-ready submission to MICRO 2026

### M7: Unified Tool Exploration (Post-Submission) 🆕
- Analyze feasibility of combining approaches
- Prototype unified performance modeling API
- If viable, develop open-source tool for community

## Current Status

**Active Milestone:** M6 - Submission Ready

**Critical:** Paper must be converted from IEEEtran to official MICRO 2026 template:
- Download from https://microarch.org/micro59/submit/
- 11 pages (excluding references), 9pt Times, 2-column, single-spaced
- 1" top/bottom, 0.75" left/right margins
- No appendices, no space squeezing
